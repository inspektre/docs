Inspektre | Application Security Measured


# Inspektre

Inspektre makes it easy to measure application security at your organization.


# How does it work?
Inspektre operates in few simple steps.

1. Code is scanned for Intelligence, SAST results (Checkmarx, Deepcode.ai, Veracode and etc) for SARIF Files.
2. Security Knowledge Graphs are generated from this metadata.
3. Finally, Inspektre Dashboard displays the results.


# Dashboard
Inspektre dashboard gives an organization visibility with metrics on how code security affects the organization.

1. Organization's Security Score.
2. Top Security Goals - Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Access Control, Authorization.
3. Attacks that can potentially be realized on a codebase.
4. Automatic fulfillment of OWASP ASVS - Application Security Verification Standard.
