More information about the OWASP Foundation can be  found here   https://owasp.org . OWASP ASVS OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) is an open application security standard. information about OWASP ASVS can be  found here   https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS . Standard Objectives Help organizations adopt or adapt a high quality secure coding standard Help architects and developers build secure software by designing and building security in, and verifying that they are in place and effective by the use of unit and integration tests that implement ASVS tests Help deploy secure software via the use of repeatable, secured builds Help security reviewers use a comprehensive, consistent, high quality standard for hybrid code reviews, secure code reviews, peer code reviews, retrospectives, and work with developers to build security unit and integration tests. It is even possible to use this standard for penetration testing at Level 1 Assist tool vendors by ensuring there is an easily generatable machine readable version, with CWE mappings Assist organizations to benchmark application security tools by the percentage of coverage of the ASVS for dynamic, interactive, and static analysis tools Minimize overlapping and competing requirements from other standards, by either aligning strongly with them (NIST 800-63), or being strict supersets (OWASP Top 10 2017, PCI DSS 3.2.1), which will help reduce compliance costs, effort, and time wasted in accepting unnecessary differences as risks. Automating Verifications ASVS is a part of the Inspektre's Knowledge Graph Ontology and helps to automate tracking. When a specific threat is marked as remediated or not relevant, Inspektre can automatically track the relevant ASVS Verification. Further, Inspektre Dashboard helps track the relevant ASVS Tasks & Levels to establish & track metrics.

Knowledge Graphs Inspektre consumes CVEs passively to augment the knowledge graphs. This provides organization or projects to add relevance from known Vulnerabilities. Attempts are made to predict if new attacks are possible on a project based on the presense of a newer CVE. The passively augmentation must be used when: Using popular Software Composition Tools.

Knowledge Graph with Inspektre Inspektre Knowledge Graph Domain is a programmatic way to explore interlinked security data. \nWe've created ontology to help developers quicky understand potential cyber attacks that \nneed to be considered for a given software project. Interlinking domains Interlinking various domains in creating an ontology (Knowledge Graph) with Inspektre helps make real-world queries more manageable. Application Profiling (Code Intelligence) Inspektre profiles code to establish intelligence. This must be performed as an early-phase activity. By profiling the application, Inspektre establishes security domains that are relevant to a project. Instance: Authentication If a given project's code uses JWT Tokens, This information isinterpreted by Inspektre that the application uses Authentication and has Authorization. Relevant attacks related to abuse of tokens.  Using the Knowledge Graph, Inspektre predicts attacks (For instance)\nSignature Spoofing by Key Theft.\nRemote Services with Stolen Credentials.\nToken Impersonation.\nExploiting Trust in Client\nSession Credential Falsification through Prediction"},"71ad7df3-8609-598f-ace6-6e2dcec0322e":{"slug":"/ontology/3-cwe","title":"CWE","excerpt":"What is a CWE Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a community developed list / dictionary of software & hardware weaknesses that have security implications. It serves as a common language across a plethora of security tools to serve as a baseline for identifying security weaknesses that may potentially exist. CWEs help developers and security to understand a specific class or type when performing remediation or hardening. More infomation can be  found here   https://cwe.mitre.org/ . Instance of CWE CWE-1289  represents a unique weakness that relates to weakness class where payload is received (From user or machines) and is consumed without validation. CWEs  are hireachical i.e. CWE-20 corresponds to improper input validation. Thus logically,  CWE-1289  has a  child-of  relationship with  CWE-20 . Knowledge Graphs Inspektre Knowledge Graphs treat these relationships as special properties to automaitcally produce more meaningful contexts. When code is examined to extract Code Integellicence, Information obtained is automaitcally classified into the relevant CWE hierarchy. When Inspektre is used as part of a CI/CD pipeline after SAST / IAST tools generate report, this Information is used to further augment the Knowledge graph.

Attack patterns Inspektre Knowledge Graphs use information from a repository AND/OR project configuration to automatically predict attack patterns. Each Attack Pattern has a Typical Severity as well as a likelihood associated. This makes it ideal for a Developer OR \nApplication Security engineer to search for attack patterns based on the organization's or a project's sensitivity.
