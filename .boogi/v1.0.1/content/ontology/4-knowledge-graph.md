# What is a knowledge Graph
A Knowledge graph acquires information from sources creating an ontology. 
Further, information is organized to derive meaningful information aka Knowledge.

# Knowledge Graph with Inspektre
Inspektre Knowledge Graph Domain is a programmatic way to explore interlinked security data. 
We've created ontology to help developers quicky understand potential cyber attacks that 
need to be considered for a given software project.

# Interlinking domains
Interlinking various domains in creating an ontology (Knowledge Graph) with Inspektre helps make real-world queries more manageable.

# Application Profiling (Code Intelligence)
Inspektre profiles code to establish intelligence. This must be performed as an early-phase activity.  
By profiling the application, Inspektre establishes security domains that are relevant to a project.

# Instance: Authentication
If a given project's code uses JWT Tokens,
- This information isinterpreted by Inspektre that the application uses Authentication and has Authorization.
- Relevant attacks related to abuse of tokens. 
- Using the Knowledge Graph, Inspektre predicts attacks (For instance)
  Signature Spoofing by Key Theft.
  Remote Services with Stolen Credentials.
  Token Impersonation.
  Exploiting Trust in Client
  Session Credential Falsification through Prediction
