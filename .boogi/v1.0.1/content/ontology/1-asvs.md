# OWASP
The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is an online community that produces freely-available articles, methodologies, documentation, tools, and technologies in the field of web application security. More information about the OWASP Foundation can be [found here](https://owasp.org) https://owasp.org.

# OWASP ASVS
OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) is an open application security standard. information about OWASP ASVS can be [found here](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS) https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS.

Standard Objectives
- Help organizations adopt or adapt a high quality secure coding standard
- Help architects and developers build secure software by designing and building security in, and verifying that they are in place and effective by the use of unit and integration tests that implement ASVS tests
- Help deploy secure software via the use of repeatable, secured builds
- Help security reviewers use a comprehensive, consistent, high quality standard for hybrid code reviews, secure code reviews, peer code reviews, retrospectives, and work with developers to build security unit and integration tests. It is even possible to use this standard for penetration testing at Level 1
- Assist tool vendors by ensuring there is an easily generatable machine readable version, with CWE mappings
- Assist organizations to benchmark application security tools by the percentage of coverage of the ASVS for dynamic, interactive, and static analysis tools
- Minimize overlapping and competing requirements from other standards, by either aligning strongly with them (NIST 800-63), or being strict supersets (OWASP Top 10 2017, PCI DSS 3.2.1), which will help reduce compliance costs, effort, and time wasted in accepting unnecessary differences as risks.

Automating Verifications
- ASVS is a part of the Inspektre's Knowledge Graph Ontology and helps to automate tracking.
- When a specific threat is marked as remediated or not relevant, Inspektre can automatically track the relevant ASVS Verification.
- Further, Inspektre Dashboard helps track the relevant ASVS Tasks & Levels to establish & track metrics.
